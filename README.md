# discordBotHost

A simple bot that i created just for fun

Currently available commands:
}hello - Says hello to the bot
}ping - request ping from the bot
}check <cuti> - tells you what day it is and if we have a holiday(*does not include public holidays)
}spank <User Mention> - Spanks a user by sending a response and a gif to the target user.
  
  That is all for now, will add more soon
